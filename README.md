## Motivation

## What is Libra?
Libra is a permissioned blockchain digital currency proposed by the American social media company Facebook. The project, currency and transactions are to be managed and cryptographically entrusted to the Libra Association, a membership organization founded by Facebook's subsidiary Calibra and 27 others across payment, technology, telecommunication, online marketplace, venture capital and nonprofits. The currency and network do not yet exist, and only rudimentary experimental code has been released.[2] The launch is planned to be in 2020
